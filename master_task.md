# Azbuka Master Task Plan

## Purpose

This document turns the original Russian voice-tutor idea into a sequence of independently implementable milestones. The current repository is the framework baseline only. This plan is documentation and sequencing; it does not claim that the future milestones are already implemented.

The working rule is strict: implement one milestone, verify it in the standalone browser app, record the result, and only then begin the next milestone. Avoid adding a second major capability while the current milestone is still unstable.

## Baseline: preserve before extending

**Status: framework prepared; future feature work not started.**

The baseline contains the standalone HTML prototype, the 100-item Russian Stage 1 curriculum, the 33-letter alphabet content, the current neo-brutalist visual system, browser text-to-speech playback, localStorage progress, the imported source curriculum, and a standalone-only runtime boundary.

Before feature work begins:

- Keep `standalone.html` runnable without a build step.
- Keep the Stage 1 learning order: meaning, pronunciation, say it aloud, recognize Cyrillic, use a tiny sentence.
- Keep all 33 letters and all 100 Stage 1 items available.
- Keep local progress data backward-compatible when new fields are introduced.
- Keep each milestone small enough to test manually in one short session.

## Milestone 1 — Make the learning state explicit

**Status: complete in the standalone HTML app.**

Implemented versioned local state (`version: 1`), migration from the original `goal`/`stage`/`letters` shape, per-item review records, event history, calendar-day reset handling, JSON export/import, and local-progress reset controls. JavaScript syntax and static HTTP smoke checks pass.

**Goal:** replace the prototype’s simple reviewed-item arrays with a versioned local data model that can support future features safely.

Implement:

- A versioned state object with learner preferences, daily activity, Stage 1 item records, alphabet records, and event history.
- Per-item fields for status, attempts, correct attempts, last reviewed timestamp, next review timestamp, difficulty, and streak contribution.
- A migration function from the current `localStorage` shape (`goal`, `stage`, `letters`) into the versioned shape.
- A reset/export/import control for debugging and user data portability.
- Calendar-day handling for daily progress and streaks.

Verify:

- Existing saved progress still appears after the migration.
- Refreshing the browser preserves all state.
- Corrupted or missing state falls back safely.
- Exported JSON can be imported into a clean browser session.

Do not add microphone input or new quiz types in this milestone.

## Milestone 2 — Add real review ratings and spaced repetition

**Status: complete in the standalone HTML app.**

Implemented Again/Hard/Good/Easy ratings, deterministic intervals, due-first and weak-item queue ordering, independent Stage 1 and alphabet scheduling records, visible return reasons, and a Settings debug view showing last review, rating, and next review. Browser-level checks confirmed Again (10 minutes) < Good (3 days) < Easy (7 days), overdue items are selected before untouched items, and scheduled state persists in localStorage.

**Goal:** turn review history into meaningful scheduling.

Implement:

- Rating buttons such as Again, Hard, Good, and Easy.
- A transparent scheduling algorithm with short intervals for weak items and longer intervals for mastered items.
- A due queue that prioritizes overdue items, then weak items, then new items.
- Separate scheduling for Stage 1 phrases and alphabet letters.
- A visible explanation of why an item is appearing again.
- A small debug view showing last review, rating, and next review date.

Verify:

- Again brings an item back sooner than Good or Easy.
- Easy does not make an item disappear permanently.
- Due items survive page refresh.
- The daily session selects due items before untouched future material.
- Scheduling is deterministic enough to reproduce during testing.

Do not add speech recognition in this milestone.

## Milestone 3 — Improve browser Russian audio

**Status: complete in the standalone HTML app.**

Implemented a reusable browser speech controller with Russian voice discovery and fallback selection, play/pause/replay, persisted playback speed, sentence and word playback, phonetic-guide highlighting while speech starts, and explicit loading/unavailable states. The live browser test verified distinct word/sentence utterance text, cancellation before each new utterance, speed persistence, sentence controls, and graceful behavior when no voices are exposed.

**Goal:** make listening practice dependable before asking the learner to speak.

Implement:

- A reusable audio controller around browser `speechSynthesis`.
- Russian voice discovery with graceful fallback when a native `ru-RU` voice is unavailable.
- Play, pause, replay, and adjustable playback speed.
- Sentence-level and word-level playback.
- Loading and unavailable states that do not block the lesson.
- Optional phonetic guide highlighting while audio plays, if browser support allows it.

Verify:

- Audio works on desktop and mobile browsers that expose speech synthesis.
- No duplicate speech queues accumulate after repeated taps.
- The app remains usable when speech synthesis is missing or blocked.
- Pronunciation guide text remains clearly separate from strict transliteration.

## Milestone 4 — Add learner microphone capture

**Status: complete in the standalone HTML app.**

Implemented explicit MediaRecorder capability checks, permission requests only from the Record action, local in-memory record/stop/replay/discard controls, duration tracking, permission and unsupported-browser messages, secure-context guidance, and object-URL/stream cleanup. Browser tests covered permission denial, unsupported fallback, complete record lifecycle, discard during recording, and confirmed no recording data is added to localStorage or uploaded.

**Goal:** let the learner record a response in the browser without scoring it yet.

Implement:

- `MediaRecorder` capability detection.
- Microphone permission request only after an explicit learner action.
- Record, stop, replay, and discard controls.
- Recording duration and clear permission/error messages.
- An in-memory recording path for the prototype; do not upload audio yet.
- A secure-context note for deployments that require HTTPS.

Verify:

- The user can record and replay a short Russian response.
- Permission denial leaves the rest of the app usable.
- Unsupported browsers show a useful fallback.
- Repeated recordings do not leak object URLs or stale controls.
- No audio is sent anywhere in this milestone.

## Milestone 5 — Add speech transcription

**Status: complete in the standalone HTML app.**

**Implementation path:** browser-native `SpeechRecognition`/`webkitSpeechRecognition` where available. The app performs live Russian recognition in the browser, does not upload the Milestone 4 recording Blob, does not call a server or managed speech API, and does not persist audio or transcripts. The UI explains that browser-level processing/privacy policies apply and requests explicit learner acknowledgment before starting recognition.

Implemented the idle → recording → processing → result/error state machine, Russian-language selection (`ru-RU`), interim and final transcript display, retry/reset controls, unsupported-browser fallback, permission/error messaging, and explicit separation between transcription failure and answer correctness. This path intentionally does not score pronunciation; transcript comparison begins in Milestone 6.

**Goal:** convert a learner response into text so the app can compare what was said with the target.

Choose and document one implementation path:

- Browser-native speech recognition where it is available, or
- A small server/API transcription boundary, or
- A managed speech service with explicit privacy and cost handling.

Implement:

- A transcription request state machine: idle, recording, uploading/processing, result, error.
- Russian-language selection.
- Transcript display with retry behavior.
- Explicit user consent before sending audio to a remote service.
- No fake score when transcription fails.

Verify:

- Clear speech produces a transcript for supported environments.
- Errors are distinguishable from an incorrect answer.
- The user can retry without losing the target phrase.
- Audio and transcript handling are documented for privacy.

## Milestone 6 — Add pronunciation scoring and feedback

**Status: complete in the standalone HTML app.**

Implemented transcript-level similarity only: case/punctuation/whitespace normalization, multiset word matching, deterministic F1-style partial credit, missing/extra-word feedback, likely trouble-spot guidance, and beginner-readable feedback. Scores and up to five transcript attempts are stored on the current Stage 1 review record with timestamps. Retry preserves the target phrase and prior metadata. The UI explicitly says this is not phoneme-accurate pronunciation scoring; recognition failures never receive a score.

**Goal:** give useful feedback on a spoken target phrase rather than only showing a transcript.

Start with transcript-level similarity as the first measurable version. Do not describe it as phoneme-accurate scoring.

Implement:

- Normalization for case, punctuation, and whitespace.
- Word-level comparison and partial credit.
- A score plus human-readable feedback.
- Feedback categories such as missing words, extra words, and likely syllable trouble spots.
- A retry flow that preserves the prior attempt for comparison.
- Storage of score and attempt metadata in the review record.

Later enhancement:

- Add phoneme or acoustic scoring only after the transcript-based version is reliable and its limitations are clearly communicated.

Verify:

- Exact recognition gives a high score.
- Missing or extra words lower the score predictably.
- A transcription error is not presented as a pronunciation failure.
- Feedback is actionable for a beginner.

## Milestone 7 — Add structured quiz modes

**Status: in progress — first mode complete in the standalone HTML app.**

Implemented the first mode only: Russian → English multiple choice. It is a separate focused panel, reuses the existing Stage 1 due queue, generates four English choices, gives immediate correct/incorrect feedback, records quiz review events, schedules correct answers as Good and incorrect answers as Again, and keeps the active question stable through retry even when scheduling changes queue order. The remaining six quiz modes stay disabled until independently implemented and verified.

**Goal:** expand beyond reveal cards while keeping short, manageable sessions.

Implement one mode at a time in this order:

1. Russian → English multiple choice.
2. English → Russian multiple choice.
3. Cyrillic letter recognition.
4. Sound-to-letter matching using the audio controller.
5. Typed fill-in-the-blank.
6. Typed translation.
7. Spoken response using the microphone/transcription pipeline.

For each mode:

- Reuse the due queue from spaced repetition.
- Show one clear question and one clear answer action.
- Give immediate feedback.
- Record the result as a review event.
- Keep a retry path without resetting the entire session.

Verify each mode independently before enabling the next one. Do not create a single large quiz screen with all modes mixed together.

## Milestone 8 — Add adaptive quiz selection

**Goal:** use performance to choose the next question intelligently.

Implement:

- Weak-area selection by item, letter, deck, and quiz mode.
- A balance between due reviews, new material, and confidence-building items.
- Protection against repeating the same item too many times in one session.
- A learner-visible reason such as “This one is back because it was tricky last time.”
- Difficulty tuning based on actual results rather than arbitrary labels alone.

Verify:

- Incorrect items reappear sooner.
- Strong items appear less often but still receive maintenance reviews.
- New material is introduced gradually.
- Selection remains usable when the learner has no review history.

## Milestone 9 — Add conversation scenarios

**Goal:** turn the vocabulary curriculum into guided, practical exchanges.

Start with one Russian scenario, such as meeting someone or asking for directions.

Implement:

- A short scripted dialogue with tutor and learner turns.
- English support that can be revealed without interrupting the flow.
- Listen, read, type, and speak response options where supported.
- Expected response variants rather than one exact string only.
- A safe recovery path when the learner says something unexpected.
- Scenario completion and review tagging.

Add scenarios one at a time: introduction, café, directions, shopping, and asking for help.

Verify:

- The dialogue can be completed from start to finish.
- The learner can replay any tutor turn.
- A wrong or unrecognized response receives a useful hint instead of a dead end.
- Conversation phrases link back to Stage 1 review items.

## Milestone 10 — Add story and comprehension practice

**Goal:** build connected reading/listening practice from known vocabulary.

Implement:

- One beginner Russian story with translation reveal.
- Audio playback for the story.
- Vocabulary highlighting for known and new words.
- Three comprehension questions.
- A cloze or fill-the-blank activity.
- Story vocabulary linked to the review queue.

Verify:

- The story is understandable using the learner’s available support.
- Questions are answerable from the text.
- Unknown vocabulary can be reviewed without abandoning the story.
- The activity remains short enough for a daily session.

## Milestone 11 — Add grammar and cultural context

**Goal:** provide small, relevant explanations at the moment of need.

Implement:

- A structured tip format with title, explanation, example, and optional “learn more.”
- Russian-specific beginner topics such as formal/informal you, soft sign behavior, stress, and pronunciation changes.
- Cultural notes attached to relevant vocabulary or scenarios.
- A dismissible tip that does not interrupt the core lesson.

Verify:

- Tips appear only when relevant.
- Tips do not overload the learner with grammar terminology.
- Every explanation has an example.
- Content can be updated independently from UI code.

## Milestone 12 — Add motivation and habit mechanics

**Goal:** make progress visible without turning practice into noise.

Implement:

- XP for completed reviews, quiz results, speaking attempts, and scenario completion.
- A small badge system tied to meaningful milestones.
- Streak calculation based on actual activity dates.
- Daily and weekly goals.
- A private progress summary before considering any leaderboard.

Optional later:

- Weekly leaderboard with clear privacy controls.
- Reminder notifications or email/SMS through a separate opt-in service.

Verify:

- XP cannot be duplicated by refreshing or replaying a completed state.
- Streaks handle missed days correctly.
- Goals are editable and persist.
- Motivation never replaces the learning feedback.

## Milestone 13 — Add durable accounts and sync

**Goal:** make progress portable across devices after the local learning loop is trustworthy.

Implement only after localStorage behavior and the review model are stable:

- Authentication.
- Server-side learner profile.
- Conflict-safe synchronization of review events.
- Backup/export and account deletion.
- Privacy documentation for audio and transcripts.

Verify:

- Local progress can be migrated into an account.
- Multiple devices converge without silently losing reviews.
- A user can export and delete their data.
- The app still works offline for the basic local loop.

## Milestone 14 — Standalone browser hardening

**Goal:** harden the standalone HTML app for reliable browser use and optional PWA packaging without introducing a mobile framework.

Evaluate:

- Installability and offline caching.
- Mobile microphone behavior.
- Audio behavior on iOS and Android browsers.
- Touch targets and one-handed layout.
- Push notifications.
- Whether a PWA manifest and service worker are worthwhile for the standalone browser experience.

Do not begin this milestone until the browser experience has a reliable learning loop and voice flow.

## Definition of done for the full roadmap

The product is ready for a broader release when a beginner can:

- Start with no Cyrillic knowledge.
- Complete short Russian sessions with clear progress.
- Hear native-language prompts and respond by typing or speaking.
- Receive honest, useful feedback on pronunciation and recall.
- Encounter difficult material again at the right time.
- Practice vocabulary in quizzes, scenarios, and stories.
- Understand why an answer was corrected.
- Resume across sessions without losing progress.
- Use the app without being overwhelmed by every feature at once.

## Working checklist for every milestone

Before starting a milestone:

- Define the smallest user-visible behavior.
- Identify the state fields and content required.
- Decide what remains intentionally out of scope.

After implementation:

- Test the happy path.
- Test refresh and empty-state behavior.
- Test an error or unsupported-device path.
- Check that old local progress still loads.
- Update this plan with the actual result and any limitation.
- Only then start the next milestone.
